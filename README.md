I made this GitHub account for this lesson's lab.

I created and cloned this repository, made some changes through "commit" and "push original".

To clone the repository on my computer, I first created a repository on github and made it a readme file. I then downloaded the desktop app, selected the repository I wanted to clone, and then selected the location for it to be cloned in the labs folder under CTI - 110.

# About Me

## My Interests 
 * I love playing _Badminton_. And I have been playing this game since I was in _Grade 4_  
 * I like to explore **new** places. I explored many places in continents such as, **_Asia_ and _Europe_**.  
 * I like to **_shop_** a little. I love to shop if it is "_necessary_", but not very often.   
## Websites I recommend using:
 1. -[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)   I find the website really interesting because it has interactive tutorials and great examples of coding.  
 2. -[Code.org](https://code.org)   This website allows students to learn about Technology in an interactive and fun way.  

>I really am grateful to have taken this class, it helps me revise what I have previously learnt and also digs a little deep into the same topic.
