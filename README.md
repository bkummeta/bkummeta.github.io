I made this GitHub account for this lesson's lab.

I created and cloned this repository, made some changes through "commit" and "push original".

To clone the repository on my computer, I first created a repository on github and made it a readme file. I then downloaded the desktop app, selected the repository I wanted to clone, and then selected the location for it to be cloned in the labs folder under CTI - 110.
