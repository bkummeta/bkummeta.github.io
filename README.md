I made this GitHub account for this lesson's lab.

I created and cloned this repository, made some changes through "commit" and "push original".

To clone the repository on my computer, I first created a repository on github and made it a readme file. I then downloaded the desktop app, selected the repository I wanted to clone, and then selected the location for it to be cloned in the labs folder under CTI - 110.

## Websites I recommend
 -[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)   I find the website really interesting because it has interactive tutorials and great examples of coding.

I really am grateful to have taken this class, it helps me revise what I have previously learnt and also digs a little deep into the same topic.
